**A Proposal for an Infinitely Recursive Function Naming Convention (IRFNC)**

**Status of this Memo**

This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practice for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvement. Or not. Мы почти уверены, что это идеально. Distribution of this memo is unlimited, especially if you find it funny.

**Abstract**

This RFC addresses the pressing need for a standardized, scalable, and infinitely expressive naming convention for functions within software development. Building upon the observed de facto standard "func_func" for functions that operate on or are conceptually subsequent to a "func", this document formalizes and extends this pattern into an infinitely recursive model. The goal is to enhance clarity, promote consistency, and provide boundless opportunities for self-documentation and job security.

**1. Introduction**

In the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, clarity and consistency in naming conventions are paramount. Developers frequently encounter functions whose names reflect a layered or sequential relationship to a base concept, often denoted by the prefix "func". A common, yet hitherto unformalized, pattern is the emergence of "func_func", signifying a function related to "func" in a secondary capacity.

This document proposes the "Infinitely Recursive Function Naming Convention" (IRFNC) to standardize this practice. The core tenet of IRFNC is that if a function operates on, refines, or is conceptually "after" `func_..._func` (where `...` represents N repetitions of `_func`), then its name MUST be `func_..._func_func`.

**2. Terminology**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119], but with a knowing wink.

*   **Func Quantum (FQ):** The string "func". This is the fundamental building block of all function names under this convention.
*   **Recursive Depth (RD):** The number of "Func Quanta" present in a function name. For `func`, RD=1. For `func_func`, RD=2. For `func_func_func`, RD=3, and so on.
*   **Sacred Separator (SS):** The underscore character `_`. It MUST be used to separate consecutive Func Quanta.

**3. The IRFNC Naming Scheme**

The naming scheme is defined as follows:

*   **Level 0 (The Primordial Func):** A base-level function, often the first of its kind, SHALL be named:
    `func`
    *(RD=1)*

*   **Level 1 (The Meta Func):** A function that operates on `func`, is a more specific version of `func`, or logically follows `func` SHALL be named:
    `func_func`
    *(RD=2)*

*   **Level 2 (The Meta-Meta Func):** A function that operates on `func_func`, is a more specific version of `func_func`, or logically follows `func_func` SHALL be named:
    `func_func_func`
    *(RD=3)*

*   **Level N (The N-th Order Func):** Following the pattern, a function at recursive depth N+1 SHALL be named by appending `_func` to a function name of recursive depth N.
    `func_func_..._func` (N+1 times "func")
    *(RD=N+1)*

**4. Rationale and Benefits**

The adoption of IRFNC offers numerous advantages:

*   **Unambiguous Recursive Depth:** The name of the function directly and unequivocally indicates its conceptual depth or level of meta-ness. `func_func_func_func` is clearly more "meta" than `func_func`.
*   **Enhanced Readability (Self-Documenting Code):** Developers can immediately grasp the hierarchical or sequential nature of the function just by reading its name. No more guessing if `processDataAdvanced` is more advanced than `processDataSuperAdvanced`.
*   **Infinite Scalability:** As software systems grow in complexity, IRFNC provides an infinitely scalable naming system. Worried about running out of adjectives? Fear no more!
*   **Job Security:** Refactoring existing codebases to comply with IRFNC, and subsequently extending them, will provide gainful employment for generations of developers. The task of adding another `_func` is both trivial and essential.
*   **Aesthetic Appeal:** A codebase consistently adhering to IRFNC possesses a certain rhythmic, hypnotic beauty.
*   **Ease of Generation:** Scripting the creation of new function names becomes trivially easy. `new_func_name = old_func_name + "_func"`.
*   **Searchability:** Finding all functions of a certain recursive depth is a simple matter of counting `_func` occurrences.

**5. Implementation Guidelines**

*   All new functions whose purpose aligns with the recursive nature described herein MUST adhere to IRFNC.
*   Existing codebases SHOULD be refactored to IRFNC compliance, starting with the most egregiously named functions. A "Big Bang" func-ification is recommended for maximum impact and team-building (or breaking).
*   Tooling (linters, IDE plugins) SHOULD be developed to enforce IRFNC and to auto-suggest the next `_func` iteration.
*   The maximum length of a function name under IRFNC is limited only by the underlying filesystem, compiler, and the developer's ability to type without error.

**6. Edge Cases and Considerations**

*   **Functions not fitting the `func` paradigm:** While this RFC primarily addresses the `func` lineage, the authors acknowledge that functions like `get_data`, `set_value` exist. Future RFCs MAY explore `get_get_data`, `set_set_value_value`, etc. For now, these are outside the scope of IRFNC.
*   **Non-Recursive Sibling Functions:** If `func_alpha` and `func_beta` are siblings, they remain as such. IRFNC applies when `func_beta` is conceptually *derived from* or *acts upon* `func_alpha` (which would then be `func_func_alpha` if `func_alpha` was just `func`). This area requires further meditation and perhaps a new `_sibling` separator.
*   **Typos:** A typo such as `finc_func` or `func-func` is a serious breach of protocol and MUST be corrected immediately, possibly through public shaming.

**7. Security Considerations**

*   Excessively long function names resulting from high Recursive Depths MAY lead to buffer overflows in less robust parsing tools or developer cognitive overflows.
*   Malicious actors COULD attempt a Denial of Service attack by submitting pull requests with functions named `func` repeated thousands of times, thereby crashing code review tools or inducing carpal tunnel syndrome in reviewers.
*   The sheer predictability of this naming scheme might, in some obscure theoretical scenario, aid an attacker. However, the clarity gained is deemed a worthy trade-off. If your security relies on obscure function names, you have bigger `func_problems`.

**8. IANA Considerations**

IANA is requested to reserve the `.func` top-level domain for websites dedicated to the celebration and proliferation of IRFNC.
Furthermore, a new file extension `.fffff` (for "Func Func Func Func Func" and beyond) for source code exclusively using this convention is under consideration.

**9. Acknowledgements**

The authors wish to thank Vlad for his prescient observation of the "func_func" pattern and the logical, if slightly terrifying, extrapolation that led to this proposal. May his functions always be appropriately `_func`'ed.
